# Requirements
## Introduction
This is a 14 digit smart scientific as well as professional calculator. Calculator is a scientific device which is used to perform various calculations like arithmetic, logical, trigonometry etc. This device is very easy to use and it is also used by many people including students. In our calculator our team has introduced few extra features like finding volume of cone, sphere, area of square, permutation and combination etc.
 
## Research

1. Simple Calculator : It is a basic calculator with arithmetic functions like addition, substraction, multiplication, division.
2. Scientific Calculator : In this calculator maths operations like trigonometry, matrix, permutation and combination etc can be performed.

## Cost and Features

In this calculator their will be an option of dedicated MRC which is Memory Recall and Clear as well as dedicated check keys. It will be operated from two sources which is solar power and button cell. It also includes a space for printing receipts. User can use this calculator for high level maths functions like finding area, volume, pnc and statics problem as well. Multiview display will be also there which can help user to view several calculations on the screen at one time.
By keeping the type of customer in mind we have set the base price for this calculator to Rs 3000 to Rs 4000 depending on the product type.
