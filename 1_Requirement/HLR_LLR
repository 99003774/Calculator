High level requirement:
1. Permutation and Combination.
2. Arithmetic operations.

Low level requirement:
1. Permutation: 
Input two values a and r and both the values must be int.They can never be in float.
The result value therefore will be in int using the permutation function.
   Combination: 
   Input two values c and d and both the values must be int.They can never be in float.
The result value therefore will be in int using the permutation function.
2. arithmetic Operation: 
For addition we take two numbers a and b.Bothe the numbers can be of any data type.
Then we add the two numbers.
For substraction we take two numbers a and b.Bothe the numbers can be of any data type.Then we substract the two numbers.
For multipication we take two numbers a and b.Bothe the numbers can be of any data type.
Then we multiply the two numbers.
For division we take two numbers a and b.Bothe the numbers can be of any data type.
Then we divide the two numbers.
