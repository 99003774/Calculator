High level requirement:
1. Permutation and Combination.
2. Arithmetic operations.

Low level requirement:
1. Permutation: Input two values a and r and both the values must be int.They can never be in float.
The result value therefore will be in int using the permutation function.
   Combination: Input two values c and d and both the values must be int.They can never be in float.
The result value therefore will be in int using the permutation function.
2. arithmetic Operation: For addition we take two numbers a and b.Bothe the numbers can be of any data type.
Then we add the two numbers.
